Piston is an EB-5 immigration attorney and senior partner at the firm of Piston & Carpenter, located in Troy, Mich.  Attorney Piston has practiced U.S. immigration law exclusively for over 25 years and has overseen the filing of over 10,000 successful employment-based permanent residency applications and has filed an equal number of nonimmigrant employment-based petitions. His practice focuses on the representation of foreign professionals and employers in employment-based immigration cases. However, Piston & Carpenter also handles other immigration matters, including mandamus actions in federal court, LCA audit defenses, and Administrative Procedure Act judicial review. Piston & Carpenter represents a wide range of employers and individuals in various industries. However, the majority of the firm’s business involves the representation of individuals in the computer software consulting industry. Experience with such a fast moving industry has caused Piston & Carpenter to develop a skill in filing fast, accurate nonimmigrant visa petitions. The firm also deals extensively in USCIS litigation, particularly the filing of lawsuits related to L and H visa petition denials. The firm does accept immigration court cases, but only after careful examination of the merits.  Attorney Piston has found that filing immigration related lawsuits in federal court can be an effective way of resolving the government’s errors. He has also found that the government reverses itself in over 50 percent of such cases within two to four months of filing, which negates the need for a judicial ruling. Attorney Piston can secure positive judgments for clients even when other attorneys have deemed their cases to be hopeless. By pursuing unusual legal courses or by being more aggressive than other immigration lawyers, attorney Piston is often able to revive these seemingly hopeless cases.","Piston & Carpenter, PC","4000 Livernois Road, Suite 110Troy, Michigan 48098",Investor Representation
